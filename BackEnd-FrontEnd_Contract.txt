Back End Interaction ReadMe

* Let's not worry about shooting or scores for now. If you have them, awesome. Otherwise, back burner.

* On front end, the only variables you really need to keep track of are YOUR player's id (String) and x, y coordinates (int)

* On each frame, send a PUT request to the server with the id,x,y params (x and y being the coordinates where your player just moved to)
EXAMPLE: PUT -> localhost:9081/Swarm?id=p1040&newX=640&newY=500
(You can use this to put a new player on the board OR update the position of existing player)

* The server will respond with a list of x and y coordinates for your sprites and all others

* Paint them on the screen, get Player inputs, etc.

* Send killSprite request with the id of the Sprite to be destroyed.
EXAMPLE: DELETE - > localhost:9081/Swarm?id=p1040
